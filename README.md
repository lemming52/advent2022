# Advent of Code 2022 Solutions

My set of solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022), written in Golang because _I want practice_.

## Running

My inputs from the challenges are all stored in the `inputs` directory, and at the time of writing these files are effectively hardcoded into the running.

To run a particular day (i.e. _sonarsweep_, ...)
```
go run main.go -challenge sonarsweep
```

To run all days
```
go run main.go -all
```

### Challenge Days

1 | `caloriecounting` | 14 | ` `
2 | ` ` | 15 | ` `
3 | ` ` | 16 | ` `
4 | ` ` | 17 | ` `

### Adding new template

To template out a new day, from the root directory run
```sh
python3 scripts/template.py <day_number> <challenge_name>
```
